Getting Started!
This is written by Justin Holmes on FRC1073, in an attempt to create a method for tracking the team's inventory system.

Config File
All items default to none and are ignored.
- FIELD NAME: This is where you can put the name of any needed field here.
- REQUIRED: Simple y/n to indicate if this is needed for item creation.
- UNIQUE: y/n if it is unique.
    - If UNIQUE and DEFAULT are set it will auto increment "#" in default value or at the end.
- DEFAULT: Default value. This is assumed to be "". Only indicate if other wise.

-Config must contain a field called "Part Number" for verification to occur.

To Do
-Have not implemented Unique yet...
