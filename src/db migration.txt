These are the steps being used to migrate the sqlite db into mysql

First make a strong backup.

Now we will run 
sqlite3 /data/inv_data2.db .dump > dump.sql

This will create a large file with a ton of lines....

Lets setup the mysql db, follow those setup steps in mysql_setup.readme

If you are using the dump.sql file by running the sql, well then we should do the following....
    Start by removeing the first couple of lines before the CREATE TABLE stuff.
    Then remove all CREATE TABLE calls, we want them all gone, these are kinda spread through out the file.
    Now we need to do a find and replace.
        Find: INSERT INTO items
        Replace with: INSERT INTO items (part_number, part_uuid, part_name,qty,threshold_qty,alt_part_nums,tags,status)
    Lastly before you run the SQL we should update a couple of the last lines, where they are '' instead of NULL. You need to make them NULL for now.

    Now you can run the SQL.
