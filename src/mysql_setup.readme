Ok for this ensure you have mysql setup on the normal port, and has the following setup
User with uname: invsys and pass: InvSysDB85

Now make a schema called invdb

Now ensure the db_manager is able to connect, and connect and run the db_manager this will setup all the needed tables.

This should setup all the tables in the dat_struc.json file.
